    <h1>Sign Up For Spring Camp</h1>
    
    <h2>Greetings</h2>
    
    <p>Friends and families of Foxflower, this is James and my intro for spring camp. The focus of this camp is teamwork, and it’s intended audience is all of Foxflower Elementary students.</p>
    
    <h2>Activities</h2>
    
    <p>The main activity involves building a text based interactive story. This will be accomplished by making a simple website with HTML.</p>
    
    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    
    <p>The plan is to have three teams, and each team will serve an unique and vital function. </p>
    
    <ul>Team 1 handles <strong>Coding</strong>. They learn the basics of HTML (and javascript if the project calls for it) They use this knowledge to put the design and story into action.</ul>
    
    <ul>Team 2 handles <strong>Web Design</strong>. They handle how the story should look on the webpage. Think of the webpage as the canvas, then these friends are the artists.</ul>
    
    <ul>Team 3 handles <strong>Content</strong>. A website’s purpose is to share content, and that is what this team is all about. Everything starts with this team. They write the story, make the flow charts, and create the pictures and videos.</ul>
    
    <h2>Save The Date</h2>
    
    <p>This year's spring camp is to take place <strong>Monday April 4th - Friday April 8th,  9:00am - 3:00pm</strong> .</p>
